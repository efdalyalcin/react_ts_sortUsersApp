# Project by Efdal YALCIN

This project was created by Efdal YALCIN for the RYTE Frontend Engineer & UI/UX Designer (m/f/d) CodeTest.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to simulate user data fetched from a server, allowing users to filter and sort it based on various properties while maintaining a clean and intuitive user interface.

### Data Source

The mock user data was generated using the [generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com/generator) tool. The dataset consists of 100 user profiles, providing a realistic dataset for testing and development.

### Challenges

One of the main challenges encountered during this project was time limitation, which limited the scope of filtering to the user's name only. Due to time constraints, implementing filters based on other properties was not feasible within the project timeline.

### Reusable Components

For this project, I leveraged two reusable components from previous work:

- [Search Bar Component](https://efdalyalcin.github.io/react_ts-search-user-app/): A versatile search bar component that can be tested by searching for 'Rhona Mooney' to open the table with pagination.

- An alternative version of the search bar was also used that is not ready for public release.

These components were integral in saving development time and ensuring a consistent user experience throughout the project.

### Styling

The project's styling is based on the style folder from the [Search Bar Component](https://efdalyalcin.github.io/react_ts-search-user-app/) and the iteration components. While this approach may include some unnecessary variables, it provided a quick and efficient way to maintain a cohesive visual design.
